# Blockhouse
A work trial task for Blockhouse. Attempting to implement OLI principles.

This was made using Google Colab Juypter Notebook. However, I did include a regular .py file in case you wanted to run it that way. The OFI Cross process wouldn't work as expected because there's only data from one ticker symbol (APPL).
